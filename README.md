Fonterator
==========

App for browsing default fonts included within iOS

This app solved a frequent problem for me: viewing which fonts and font families are installed by default within iOS. This app is a simple TableView which displays font families then the specific fonts within each family.

It's written in Swift so as the language evolves this code could become out of date.
