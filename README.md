Fonterator
==========

App for browsing default fonts included within iOS

This app solved a frequent problem for me: viewing which fonts and font families are installed by default within iOS. This app is a simple TableView which displays font families then the specific fonts within each family. Each font family name is displayed with the font itself as is each member.

It's written in Swift so as the language evolves this code could become out of date.

Here's a screenshot of the application displaying the font families:

And a screenshot of the application displaying each font member.
